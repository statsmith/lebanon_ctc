These would serve nicely as a summer intern project

* Include both ways on correlations
* Create module or function for pop up modals
* Customize pop up plot for gender, for each pop up, to emphasize comparisons (default was to use already available function)

* Check counter-intuitive correlations
* Documentation
* Training
